# 24 bit color (truecolor)

Delta looks best if your terminal application supports 24 bit colors. See https://github.com/termstandard/colors#readme. For example, on MacOS, iTerm2 supports 24-bit colors but Terminal.app does not.

If your terminal application does not support 24-bit color, delta will still work, by automatically choosing the closest color from those available. See the `Colors` section of the help output below.
