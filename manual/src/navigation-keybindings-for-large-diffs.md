# Navigation keybindings for large diffs

Use the `navigate` feature to activate navigation keybindings. In this mode, pressing `n` will jump forward to the next file in the diff, and `N` will jump backwards. If you are viewing multiple commits (e.g. via `git log -p`) then navigation will also visit commit boundaries.
