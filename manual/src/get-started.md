# Get started

[Install](./installation.md) delta and add this to your `~/.gitconfig`:

```gitconfig
[core]
    pager = delta

[interactive]
    diffFilter = delta --color-only

[delta]
    navigate = true    # use n and N to move between diff sections

    # delta detects terminal colors automatically; set one of these to disable auto-detection
    # dark = true
    # light = true

[merge]
    conflictstyle = zdiff3
```
